## About

Through this project, I aim to analyze how the distribution of payroll affects the performance of Major League Baseball teams. 

By comparing the distribution of payroll among positions to win percentage, runs scored, and runs allowed, we may find greater value in certain positions or position groups. 

Further analysis of age distribution on the payroll could lead to insights on the benefits of experience vs youth.
